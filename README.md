# Rosalind Problems
## Solutions to the "Bioinformatics Armory" problems from rosalind.info, solved primarily using BioPython tools



Problem 1: Count the number of each nt in a string

Problem 2: Given a protein's ID, retrieve a list of biological processes it's involved in from UniProt

Problem 3: given a genus name and a range of dates, return the number of entries in Nucleotide GenBank

Problem 4: given list of genbank gene IDs, return the fasta file of the gene with the shortest header

    
Problem 5: given a file with fastqs, convert to fasta

Problem 6: given a file with fastqs + quality threshold, print the number of fastqs that pass that threshold

Problem 7: given a file with fastqs + quality threshold + % of bases that need to meet that theshold, print the number of fastqs that pass that threshold

Problem 8: given a file with fastqs + quality threshold, trim bases from the beginning and end that don't meet that quality threshold

Problem 9: for a file containing two genbank IDs, get alignment score using Needle for fasta sequences

Problem 10: for an input DNA and aa sequence it translates to, print the codon table (1=standard, other options are 2-15) that was used to translate

Problem 11: for a list of DNA sequence, print how many match their own reverse complement

Problem 12: For a given DNA string, get the longest open reading frame (all frames, forward and reverse considered)
